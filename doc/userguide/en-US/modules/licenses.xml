    <title>Preamble</title>

    <para>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</para>

    <para>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
    specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
    Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
    can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
    this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</para>

    <para>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
    not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
    it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
    it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
    these things.</para>

    <para>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
    rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</para>

    <para>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
    you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
    complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
    it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</para>

    <para>We protect your rights with a two-step method:
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>we copyright the library, and</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>we offer you this license, which gives you legal
          permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </para>

    <para>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
    there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
    that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
    author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
    introduced by others.</para>

    <para>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
    any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
    effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
    restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
    any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
    consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</para>

    <para>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
    ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
    is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
    this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
    libraries into non-free programs.</para>

    <para>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
    combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
    General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
    entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
    Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
    the library.</para>

    <para>We call this license the <emphasis>Lesser</emphasis> General Public License because it
    does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General
    Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
    of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
    libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
    special circumstances.</para>

    <para>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
    a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
    allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
    library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
    case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
    software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</para>

    <para>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
    free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
    operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
    system.</para>

    <para>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
    users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
    linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
    that program using a modified version of the Library.</para>

    <para>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
    <quote>work based on the library</quote> and a <quote>work that uses the library</quote>.  The
    former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
    be combined with the library in order to run.</para>

    <title>Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution and Modification</title>
    <section id="lgpl-2-0">
      <title>Section 0</title>
      <para>This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
      program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
      other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
      this Lesser General Public License (also called <quote>this License</quote>).
      Each licensee is addressed as <quote>you</quote>.</para>

      <para>A <quote>library</quote> means a collection of software functions and/or data
      prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
      (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</para>

      <para>The <quote>Library</quote>, below, refers to any such software library or work
      which has been distributed under these terms.  A <quote>work based on the
      Library</quote> means either the Library or any derivative work under
      copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
      portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
      straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
      included without limitation in the term <quote>modification</quote>.)</para>

      <para><quote>Source code</quote> for a work means the preferred form of the work for
      making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
      all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
      interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
      and installation of the library.</para>

      <para>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
      covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
      running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
      such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
      on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
      writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
      and what the program that uses the Library does.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="lgpl-2-1">
      <title>Section 1</title>
      <para>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s
      complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
      you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
      appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
      all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
      warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
      Library.</para>

      <para>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
      and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a

    <section id="lgpl-2-2">
      <title>Section 2</title>
      <para>You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
      of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
      distribute such modifications or work under the terms of <link linkend="lgpl-2-1">Section 1</link>
      above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
      <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
        <listitem>
          <para>The modified work must itself be a software library.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
          charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem id="lgpl-2-2-d">
          <para>If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
          table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
          the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
          is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
          in the event an application does not supply such function or
          table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
          its purpose remains meaningful.</para>

          <para>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
          a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
          application.  Therefore, <link linkend="lgpl-2-2-d">Subsection 2d</link> requires that any
          application-supplied function or table used by this function must
          be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
          root function must still compute square roots.)</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      </para>

      <para>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
      identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
      and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
      themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
      sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
      distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
      on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
      this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
      entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
      it.</para>

      <para>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
      your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
      exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
      collective works based on the Library.</para>

      <para>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
      with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
      a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
      the scope of this License.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="lgpl-2-3">
      <title>Section 3</title>
      <para>You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
      License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
      this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
      that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
      instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
      ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
      that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
      these notices.</para>

      <para>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
      that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
      subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</para>

      <para>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
      the Library into a program that is not a library.</para>

      <para>You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or

      under the terms of <link linkend="lgpl-2-1">Sections 1</link> and <link linkend="lgpl-2-2">2</link> above provided that you accompany

      must be distributed under the terms of <link linkend="lgpl-2-1">Sections 1</link> and <link linkend="lgpl-2-2">2</link> above on a
      medium customarily used for software interchange.</para>

      <para>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
      from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
      source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
      distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
      compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="lgpl-2-5">
      <title>Section 5</title>
      <para>A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
      Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
      linked with it, is called a <quote>work that uses the Library</quote>.  Such a
      work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
      therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</para>

      <para>However, linking a <quote>work that uses the Library</quote> with the Library
      creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
      contains portions of the Library), rather than a <quote>work that uses the
      library</quote>.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
      <link linkend="lgpl-2-6">Section 6</link> states terms for distribution of such executables.</para>

      <para>When a <quote>work that uses the Library</quote> uses material from a header file
      that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
      derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
      Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
      linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
      threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</para>

      <para>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
      structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
      functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
      file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
      work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
      Library will still fall under <link linkend="lgpl-2-6">Section 6</link>.)</para>

      <para>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
      distribute the object code for the work under the terms of <link linkend="lgpl-2-6">Section 6</link>.
      Any executables containing that work also fall under <link linkend="lgpl-2-6">Section 6</link>,

    <title>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</title>

    <para>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
    everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
    ordinary General Public License).</para>

    <para>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    <quote>copyright</quote> line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</para>

    <para>&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

            agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in

            modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
            Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
            the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
            this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

            The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing

            on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO

            such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict
